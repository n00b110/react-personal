# Getting Started with React

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this post, we'll explore the basics and create your first React component.

## What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".

## Your First Component

Here's a simple React component:

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
```

## Key Concepts

### 1. Components

Components are the building blocks of React applications. They can be functional or class-based.

### 2. Props

Props allow you to pass data from parent to child components.

### 3. State

State allows components to manage their own data and re-render when it changes.

## Getting Started

To start a new React project, you can use Create React App or Vite:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
cd my-react-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics, explore:

- Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Context API
- React Router
- State management libraries

Happy coding! ðŸš€
