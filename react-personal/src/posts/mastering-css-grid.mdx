# Mastering CSS Grid Layout

CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that allows you to create complex web layouts with ease. Let's dive deep into this modern CSS feature.

## What is CSS Grid?

CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system designed for the web. It lets you lay out items in rows and columns, and has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward.

## Basic Grid Setup

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 100px 200px;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

## Grid Areas

One of the most powerful features is grid areas:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header header"
    "sidebar main main"
    "footer footer footer";
}

.header {
  grid-area: header;
}
.sidebar {
  grid-area: sidebar;
}
.main {
  grid-area: main;
}
.footer {
  grid-area: footer;
}
```

## Responsive Grid

CSS Grid makes responsive design much easier:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use semantic HTML** with grid
2. **Plan your layout** before coding
3. **Test on different screen sizes**
4. **Use grid areas** for complex layouts

## Browser Support

CSS Grid is supported in all modern browsers, making it a reliable choice for production websites.

## Conclusion

CSS Grid revolutionizes how we think about web layouts. Once you master it, you'll wonder how you ever built layouts without it!
